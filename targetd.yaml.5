.TH targetd.yaml 5
.SH NAME
targetd.yaml \- configuration file
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B targetd.yaml
is the configuration file for the targetd service.
.SH CONFIGURATION
.B targetd
uses
.B /etc/target/targetd.yaml
for configuration. It is in YAML format.
.B targetd
currently uses scalar values and collection values, see example for
details.
.SS CONFIGURATION FILE SETTINGS
.B block_pools
.br
Sets the LVM Volume Group(s) that targetd will use to allocate
volumes. Defaults to ["vg-targetd"].

Alternatively, targetd can allocate thinp (thin-provisioned) volumes
out of a thinpool LV. These should be listed as "<vgname>/<poolname>",
with the VG and thinpool LV names separated by a "/". These should
already be created; targetd will not create VGs or thinpool LVs.

If you want to use ZFS exclusively, this should be set as empty list.

.B zfs_block_pools
.br
Sets the ZFS parent dataset(s) that targetd will use to allocate
volumes. Defaults to empty list.

This should be list of already existing zfs filesystem datasets.
It cannot contain any two datasets which are in parent-child
relationship, like "tank/ds" and "tank/ds/ds2".

Using ZFS requires zfs binary to be accessible.
Cannot contain colons even though it's supported by ZFS itself.

.B zfs_enable_copy
.br
Enables copy method on ZFS volumes.
.B Warning:
copying ZFS volumes will make source volumes unable to be deleted
as long as copies exist. This is due to ZFS snapshot/clone limitations.

.B fs_pools
.br
Sets the mount point(s) that targetd will use to export filesystems
over NFS. Defaults to none.

.B user
.br
.B password
.br
Sets the username and password required to use the remote
API. "user" defaults to
.BR admin ,
but password must be set prior to using targetd.

.B target_name
.br
Sets the iSCSI target name that
.B targetd
will use. Default is
.BR iqn.2003-01.org.linux-iscsi.<hostname>:targetd .

.B log_level
.br
Set the daemon logging verbosity.  Select one of the following:
debug, info, warning, error, critical.  Defaults to "info".

.B ssl
.br
.B ssl_key
.br
.B ssl_cert
.br
Settings for enabling SSL/TLS encryption.
.B ssl
defaults to
.BR off .
If enabled, it will default to looking for key and cert files named
.B targetd_key.pem
and
.BR targetd_cert.pem
in
.BR /etc/target .
These paths may also be specified, using the
.B ssl_key
and
.B ssl_cert
config settings.

Key and self-signed cert may be generated using openssl:

.B openssl genrsa -out targetd_key.pem 2048
.br
.B openssl req -new -x509 -key targetd_key.pem -out targetd_cert.pem -days 9999
